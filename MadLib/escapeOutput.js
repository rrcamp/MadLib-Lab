"I was tired of my " + {{partner}} + ", wed been together too long.
Like a worn out recording of a favorite song.
So while " + {{sheOrHe}} + " lay there sleepin I read the paper in bed.
And in the personal columns, there was this letter I read.

If you like " + {{favouriteFood}} + "s and getting " + {{pastTenseVerb}} + " in the rain.
If youre not into " + {{activity}} + ", if you have half a brain.
If you like making love at midnight in the " + {{naturalFormation} + "s of " + {{place}} + ".
Then Im the love that youve looked for, write to me and escape.

I didnt think about my " + {{partner}} + ", I know that sounds kind of mean.
But me and my old " + {{partner}} + " had fallen into the same old dull routine.
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad.
And though Im nobodys poet, I thought it wasnt half bad.

Yes, I like " + {{favouriteFood}} + " and getting " + {{pastTenseVerb}} + " in the rain
Im not much into " + {{activity}} + ", I am into champagne.
Ive got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape.
At a bar called " + {{favouriteDetroitBar}} + " where well plan our escape.

So I waited with high hopes and " + {{heOrShe}} + " walked in the place.
I knew " + {{hisOrHer}} + " smile in an instant, I knew the curve of " + {{hisOrHer}} + " face.
It was my own lovely " + {{partner}} + " and " + {{sheOrHe}} + " said, Aw, its you.
Then we laughed for a moment and I said, I never knew.

That you like " + {{favouriteFood}} + "s and gettin caught in the rain.
And the feel of the ocean and the taste of champagne.
If you like making love at midnight in the " + {{naturalFormation}}"s on the " + {{place}} + ".
Youre the " + {{partner}}" + "" Ive looked for, come with me and escape.

If you like " + {{favouriteFood}} + " and getting " + {{verb}} + " in the rain
If youre not into " + {{activity}} + ", if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight in the {{naturalFormation}} on the {{place}}
Then Im the love that youve looked for, write to me and escape.

Yes I like " + {{favouriteFood}} + " and getting caught in the rain.
Im not much into " + {{activity}} + ", I am into champagne.
Ive got to meet you by tomorrow noon and cut through all this red tape."
